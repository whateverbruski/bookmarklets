zMatrix	I’m going to give you a list of tasks or thoughts. Your job is to:<br />Classify them into the four Eisenhower Matrix quadrants:<br /><br />urgent and important<br />just important<br />not important but urgent<br />nothing<br /><br />Sort using reasoning based on the following rules:<br />Financial consequences = higher priority  <br />Commitments or promises to others = Important  <br />Wording or topic that implies time-sensitivity = Urgent<br /><br />Do not treat emotional friction or difficulty as a reason to change quadrant  <br />Use common sense and read between the lines to infer implied urgency or importance  <br />Remove any obvious duplicates or postponed versions of the same task<br />Avoid whitespace at the end of sentences/lines of text<br /><br />Return your output in the following raw .txt format (all items should begin with a lowercase dot and stay lowercase):<br /><br />urgent and important  <br />.item  <br />.item  <br /><br />just important  <br />.item  <br />.item  <br /><br />not important but urgent  <br />.item  <br />.item  <br /><br />nothing  <br />.item  <br />.item  <br /><br />Then, after the list, write short explanations showing why each item went where it did.  <br />Here’s the list to sort:<br />"<br />%pasteboard<br />"<br /><br />and here's a list of non-actionable items that pertain to preocupations arround the actionable items you can also use for context and what the criteria for determining importance or urgency is, since that's what I wrote them for, to help me think about what there is to do:<br /><br />"<br />%filltext:name=non-actionables:width=20%<br />"
zQuestions	Prompt me with a set of yes-or-no questions that help me reflect—so that, in answering, I naturally clarify my own thinking on %filltext:name=goal:width=20%. Then, using those responses (and any extra context I give), craft a response that is precise, relevant, and pragmatically useful to what I actually need. The other day you gave me the list of questions in a format like this and I loved it:<br /><br />{question}?<br />→ r/
zRemember	"I just took note—some actionable (todos), some not (just thoughts)—while planning my day for tomorrow. Before diving in, I want to make sure I’m not forgetting anything I still need to handle, even if it’s not on this list yet.

Here’s what I’ve got so far:

""
%pasteboard
""
and here's a list of non-actionable items that pertain to preocupations arround the actionable items you can also use for context and what the criteria for determining importance or urgency is, since that's what I wrote them for, to help me think about what there is to do:

""
%filltext:name=non-actionables:width=20%

zShuffle	"I’m going to give you a list of actionable items as plain text. Each item starts with a dot and is all lowercase. Your job is to **shuffle the list randomly using Python**, not your own internal logic. Preserve the exact formatting — one line per item, all starting with a dot, with no changes to the wording, punctuation, or capitalization.

Here is the list (as a raw string):

""""""%pasteboard""""""

Use the `random` module in Python to shuffle the list and return the **shuffled list only**, formatted exactly like the input: one item per line, starting with a dot. No added text, no explanation, no comments."
zSort	I’m going to give you a list of tasks that all belong to the same Eisenhower Matrix quadrant. Your job is to sort the list top-to-bottom using advanced reasoning and behavioral psychology to maximize likelihood of execution.<br /><br />The list is raw, lowercase, and starts each line with a dot. Keep the format exactly as-is—no categories, no sections, just a reordered version of the same items.<br /><br />Sort the list with the following logic:<br /><br />- Tasks with higher **real-world negative consequences** (financial, opportunity loss, potential for stress or regret) come earlier<br />- **Prerequisite logic**: if one task logically unlocks another, place it first<br />- Commitments or things involving **others’ expectations or communication** go earlier<br />- Quick wins or **very fast tasks** (under ~5 mins) float up early for momentum—but only if they don’t block more important ones<br />- Tasks with **external time sensitivity** (e.g., offices, payments, deadlines) move up<br />- Items that are **blocking other routines, habits, or decisions** are prioritized<br />- Vague, underspecified, or confusing items get moved lower<br />- Grouping by **context** is allowed (e.g., all errands or phone calls near each other), but list stays flat—no headers or extra formatting<br />- Emotionally draining or unpleasant tasks are **not deprioritized** just for that<br />- If something is **easy to do right now** (inferred from tone or typical availability), it can be nudged upward to build execution momentum<br />- Avoid whitespace at the end of sentences/lines of text<br /><br />Here’s the list to sort:<br />"<br />%pasteboard<br />"<br />and here's a list of non-actionable items that pertain to preocupations arround the actionable items you can also use for context and what the criteria for determining importance or urgency is, since that's what I wrote them for, to help me think about what there is to do:<br /><br />"<br />%filltext:name=non-actionables:width=20%<br />"
